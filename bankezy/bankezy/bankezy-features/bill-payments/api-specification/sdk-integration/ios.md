# iOS

## Step 1: SDK and dependencies

Include .framework library into the project\
Name : MarketPlaceSDK.framework

General -> Frameworks -> Embed\&Sign

## Step 2: Get client public key

Invoke the SDK to get the client public key

```
Invoke the SDK to get the Client Public key 
Import “MarketPlaceSDK” 

let bridge = WFSDKBridge() 

bridge.onCertificateFetch { (publicKey, status) in 
    //Will return client public key and true status if success or false status if public key could not be generated by SDK 
  } 
```

## Step 3: Initialisation of SDK

Fetch the token data from your server by passing the sdkPublicKey received at step 2.

Create a JSON object from the response received.

```
// Example to create a JSON Object
let jsonObject: [String: Any] = [  
" referenceId ": “”, 
" token ": “”, 
" expiry ": ””, 
"serverPublicKey ": “” 
] 
let valid = JSONSerialization.isValidJSONObject(jsonObject) // true  
let jsonData: NSData 
    do{ 
        jsonData = try NSJSONSerialization.dataWithJSONObject(para, options: NSJSONWritingOptions())  
    } catch _ { 
            print ("Oops!") 
    } 
    // JSON Data created = jsonData
```

Invoke the SDK by providing the JSON Object constructed in the previous step along with PartnerCode shared offline and the environment mode.

```
String partnerCode = <Data will be shared offine>; 
String envMode = “UAT”; //”UAT”, “PROD” 
String healthCheckSpanTime = 1800; //Optional, TimeInMilliSec             
//Method to initilise SDK
  bridge.initializeSDK(tokenObj: <#T##Data#>, partnerCode: <#T##String#>, envt: <#T##String#>, healthCheckFrequency: <#T##Double#>)
   
```

Confirm to a protocol named WFCallbackHandler, which contains the following stubs:

**onSDKInitialisationComplete** – When SDK is initialised successfully

**onSDKInitialisationFailed** – When SDK initialisation fails

**onTokenExpired** – When token is expired in SDK

**receiveWibmoHealthCheck** – Heartbeat call back with status \[To intimate the app if the user in active]

**onSDKProcessComplete** – When user exits out of Market place SDK back to Parent App

```
extension ViewController:WFCallbackHandler { 
  func onSDKInitialisationFailed(status: WFStatus) { 
    //Callback received if the initialization failed and control will be given back to the app.  
   } 
  func onSDKInitialisationComplete(status: WFStatus) { 
    //Callback received if the initialization is success and user will be navigated to the Marketplace dashboard 
  } 
  func onTokenExpired() { 
    // Callback received when the token provided has expired.  
  } 
 func receiveWibmoHealthCheck(status: WFStatus) { 
    // Callback received at regular interval based on healthCheckFrequency provided, else will be invoked at the default time which is 30 seconds configured in the SDK.  
  } 
  func onSDKProcessComplete(statusCode: String, statusDesc: String) { 
     // Callback received either when user intentionally navigates out from the SDK or when the SDK forcefully quits based on any technical error.        
} 
} 
```

## SDK Status code & Description

“000” - Success

“050” - Technical Error. Please retry.
