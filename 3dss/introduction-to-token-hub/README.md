# Introduction to 3DSS

**What is 3D Secure Authentication?**

3D Secure authentication, also known as a payer authentication, is a security protocol that helps to prevent fraud for online credit card and debit card transactions. It allows banks to request extra details from a card holder to verify a purchase.

3D stands for “three domains.” The first is the card issuer, second is the retailer receiving the payment, and third is the 3DS infrastructure platform that acts as a secure gateway between the consumer and the retailer. Created by Visa and MasterCard, 3D Secure , also referred to as 3DS is a technical standard that adds a layer of security in online credit and debit card transactions.

The technology is named the same because every 3D Secure transaction involves three parties.
