# Overview

## Business challenge

One of the fastest growing segment of digital payment includes recurring/subscription payments requiring Merchants, Acquirers, Fintechs to provide a seamless consumer experience for repeat payments either merchant initiated e.g. online subscriptions like OTT, media, utilities etc or customer initiated e.g. frequently visited shopping, food, grocery etc. in both the scenarios security and convenience is the key factor where consumer trusts the merchant with their payment credentials to store them securely to enable them faster checkout experience. Currently there is no industry standard or globally accepted norms to provide this feature in a consistent manner. It varies from region by Merchant, Fintech or acquirer. Recently RBI in India had published guidelines restricting the entities which can store card credentials while publishing guidelines on card storage impacting Merchants, Acquirers and Fintechs to adopt the standards. RBI issued guidelines can serve as a best practice for other countries too to securely serve the recurring digital payments seamlessly for Card on File as well as contactless device payments.
