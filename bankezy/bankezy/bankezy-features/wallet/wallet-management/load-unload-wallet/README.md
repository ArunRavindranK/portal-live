# Load/Unload Wallet

For Loading funds into wallet, there are 2 steps. First, we need to capture funds from the source card/account of the user. Second, we need to load the funds into the user's wallet card. In order to facilitate the first step, BankEzy provides a standalone payment solution which is seamlessly integrated with the BankEzy wallet offerings.&#x20;

For Banks/Merchants/Fintechs/NBFCs who wish to fully take care of the capturing of funds, they can only consume the load money API from BankEzy which will load the funds into user's wallet card. Wallet Pool account prefunding will be required in such scenarios.

The below diagram explains the load money flow. Payment process flow used in load/unload wallet can be referred [here](../../../payment/).
